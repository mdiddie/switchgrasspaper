        <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
        <p>Aya Nakamura and Megan Diddie are Chicago based artists who became friends at the School of the Art Institute in 2011 while acquiring  post-baccalaureate degrees. As their studio practices developed they started using handmade paper and pulp for their projects. Megan Diddie attended the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana for graduate school where she was fortunate to get a job as the studio manager of Fresh Press Laboratory. Fresh Press is a papermaking studio founded by Eric Benson and Steve Kostell that explores different materials for papermaking and sustainable design practices. After graduate school Megan came back to Fresh Press to work on projects and brought Aya. Aya has been traveling to Fresh Press to make pulp for her works on paper and sculptural pieces. The journey to use the studio is about a two hour drive one way. Fresh Press has been a wonderful resource. In the Spring of 2022 Aya and Megan started talking about how they could bring papermaking to Chicago and what that might look like. Switch Grass Paper is the idea born from months of conversations about papermaking, prairie, land immersion, and art. In the Fall of 2022 they attended the Chop Wood Carry Water residency together where they solidified plans to make their idea into a reality.
