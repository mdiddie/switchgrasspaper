        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Aya Nakamura and Megan Diddie are Chicago based artists who became friends at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. As their studio practices evolved, they started incorporating handmade paper and pulp into their work. Megan Diddie attended the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana for graduate school. During this time, she worked as a graduate research assistant at Fresh Press Laboratory, a papermaking studio founded by Eric Benson and Steve Kostell. Fresh Press explores different materials for papermaking and sustainable design practices. After graduate school, Megan introduced Aya to the studio and they began traveling together to access the equipment. The journey to the studio from Chicago is two hours one way. During these long drives, they began talking about how they could bring papermaking to Chicago. Switch Grass Paper is the idea born out of months of conversations about papermaking, prairie, land immersion, and art.

        <h3>What's Happening Now</h3>
        <p> We are currently in the process of applying for grants and fundraising to buy papermaking equipment. We would like to run a series of papermaking workshops in Chicago in 2023 and 2024. Our first series of workshops will focus on paper made with prairie grasses. We have both been inspired by the prairies of Illinois and want to use locally sourced fibers to foster discussions about landscape and plants during the workshops. Our long term goal is to run a studio space for those interested in accessing equipment, learning about papermaking, and experimenting with fiber materials. You can follow our story on Instagram.
        <br>
      
        <p>The Latest : We ran a successful Indiegogo campaign and raised enough funds to purchase a Holland Beater. This piece of equipment is integral for getting our project started because it will allow us to make pulp from a variety of materials. Thank you so much to everyone who donated or purchased a ticket to one of our summer fundraiser workshops. </a>
        </p>
        <p>As part of our fundraiser we are hosting three papermaking workshops this summer in August. We still have room for a couple more participants for our workshop at Comfort Station on Sunday, August 20th and at Spudnik Press on Sunday, August 27th. If you are interested in signing up please e-mail us and we will send you the details for purchasing a ticket. We can be reached at switchgrasspaper@gmail.com</p>

        <p>As artists working with handmade paper, we have experimented with it to see what it can do. We have made books and sculptures from it, created shaped molds to give it new form, and embedded materials into it to add layers of meaning. We envision Switch Grass as a studio that empowers us to explore, share knowledge and connect.</p>
