        <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
        <p>Aya Nakamura and Megan Diddie are Chicago based artists who became friends at The School of the Art Institute. As their studio practices developed they started using handmade paper and pulp in their art practices. Megan Diddie attended the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana for graduate school. During this time, she worked as a graduate research assistant at Fresh Press Laboratory. Fresh Press is a papermaking studio founded by Eric Benson and Steve Kostell that explores different materials for papermaking and sustainable design practices. After graduate school, Megan introduced Aya to the studio and they began traveling together to access the equipment. The journey to the studio from Chicago is two hours one way. During these long drives, Aya and Megan started talking about how they could bring papermaking to Chicago. Switch Grass Paper is the idea born from months of conversations about papermaking, prairie, land immersion, and art.

        <h3>What's happening now</h3>
        <p> We are currently in the process of applying to grants and fundraising to buy papermaking equipment. We want to run a series of papermaking workshops in Chicago in 2023 and 2024. Our first series of workshops will focus on paper made with prairie grasses. We have both been inspired by the prairies of Illinois and want to use locally sourced fibers to foster discussions about landscape and plants during the workshops.  Our longterm goal is to run a studio space for those interested in accessing equipment, learn about papermaking, and experimenting with fiber materials. You can follow our story on Instagram.
